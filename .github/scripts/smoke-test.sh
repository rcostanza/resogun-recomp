# Checks an unpacked Linux release (tools/package.py) on a distro it was not built on. Run as root in
# a fresh container of that distro (.github/workflows/build.yml): it installs what a desktop already
# has (python3, the Vulkan loader, the X11/Wayland/audio libraries the release leaves to the host),
# then checks without a game dump or a GPU:
#   - the programs find every library (ldd) and start: a missing one or a too-new glibc stops them;
#   - the game, never set up, says so; resogun-setup rejects a folder that is not a dump, and
#     with one that looks like a dump runs prepare/run.py through the system python3 to its end;
#   - a set-up folder (paths.ini, game/) starts the game from it, logging to <save>/log.
# Usage: smoke-test.sh <unpacked release folder>
